<h1>My Gaming Experience</h1>
<p>I have been playing video games ever since I was a child, and even looking back to my oldest memories, I can remember being a fan of gaming </p>
<p>Gaming has always been a part of my life, and although many brush it off as a waste of time or something that isn't productive, it has been growing in popularity</p>
<p>Quickly becoming one of the biggest markets, for both gamers that make money playing, and game creators.</p>

<h2>Gaming Achievements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I have reached Diamond ranked in League of Legends, which puts me at the top 0.5% of skilled playerbase among the NA region.<li>
  <li>Thanks to my Ranking in League of Legends, I have been invited, and payed to test content which hasn't been released yet.<li>
  <li>Have been in several tournaments for League of Legends</li>
  <li>Have made made money in the past for playing video games</li>
</ul>  
<h2>What I hope to achieve</h2>
<p>I hope in the future to able to compete professionally, and maybe even attempt to make it into the esports scene</p>
<p>although I may be a bit away from achieving that level, with enough patience and time, I may be able to achieve that goal.</p>
